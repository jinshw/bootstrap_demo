        <p>PHP, an acronym for Hypertext Preprocessor, is a widely-used open source general-purpose scripting language. It is an HTML embedded scripting language and is especially suited for web development. The basic syntax of PHP is similar to C, Java, and Perl, and is easy to learn. PHP is used for creating interactive and dynamic web pages quickly, but you can do much more with PHP.
        </p>
        <h4 id="js">JS</h4>
        <p>
            JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language developed by Netscape. JavaScript was created by Netscape programmer Brendan Eich. It was first released under the name of LiveScript as part of Netscape Navigator 2.0 in September 1995. It was renamed JavaScript on December 4, 1995. As JavaScript works on the client side, It is mostly used for client-side web development.

        <p>
            In 1986 the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the Army Research Office (ARO), the National Science Foundation (NSF), and ESL, Inc sponsored Berkeley POSTGRES Project which was led by Michael Stonebrakessr. In 1987 the first demo version of the project is released. In June 1989, Version 1 was released to some external users. Version 2 and 3 were released in 1990 and 1991. Version 3 had support for multiple storage managers, an query executor was improved, rule system was rewritten. After that, POSTGRES has been started to be implemented in various research and development projects. For example, in late 1992, POSTGRES became the primary data manager for the Sequoia 2000 scientific computing project4. User community around the project also has been started increasing; by 1993, it was doubled.

        <p>
            The term NoSQL was coined by Carlo Strozzi in the year 1998. He used this term to name his Open Source, Light Weight, DataBase which did not have an SQL interface.In the early 2009, when last.fm wanted to organize an event on open-source distributed databases, Eric Evans, a Rackspace employee, reused the term to refer databases which are non-relational, distributed, and does not conform to atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability - four obvious features of traditional relational database systems.
